# IBM-Cloud-NYC-Restaurant-Information

New York City is home to some of the worlds most renoun and prestigious restaurants with a wide variety of different cuisines, franchises, and fusions of food that one can't find anywhere else. 
The restaurant industry in New York City is thriving, earning $17 Billion USD in 2018 with 31,061 number of businesses and an annual growth rate of 4.6% 
and an increased projection of profit and new businesses in 2019. 

Because many New Yorkers and tourists rely on local restaurants  it is important to know whether or not the restaurants 
we trust are serving us contaminated food. 
In this project I aim to explore the data from NYC Open Data and try to learn more about the health violation reports
from the NYDOH and visualize trends
in the data. I also intend on implementing machine learning techniques to find hotspots of violations in the city, and also create an 
interactive map where it is possible to find where these restaurants are and which health violations they have commited.


Although I am not a Data Scientist I thought it would be fun to explore the data and see exactly what type of insights I could find. 
I hope you find them as intreaguing as I do.
